During the Promotion Period, Seller shall ensure the non-discounted price for all Eligible Items (defined below) shall be no greater than the price of such Eligible Items listed by Seller on the eBay Site in the seven (7) days preceding the Promotion Period.

eBay Responsibilities

During the Promotion Period, eBay shall directly or indirectly distribute one or more promotional codes (“Coupons”), which shall be redeemable by the qualifying recipient for the discount specified in Attachment 1 (“Discount”) from the purchase price of certain items as specified in Attachment 1(“Eligible Items”) purchased by the qualifying recipient from Seller.  Seller agrees to reimburse eBay as described in this Agreement for all or a portion of the Discount as described in column &quot;Seller Funded Amount&quot; in Attachment 1 (&quot;Seller Funded Amount&quot;).
The Coupons shall be subject to eBay’s Coupon Terms and Conditions (a sample of which is contained in Attachment 2), which eBay may revise from time to time. The Coupons may be used by qualifying recipients during the Coupon Validity Period described in Attachment 1 and shall expire on the last day of the Coupon Validity Period.
During the Promotion Period, eBay may, in its sole discretion, promote Seller’s listings of Eligible Items, which may include promotion on the eBay Site, appropriate category pages on the eBay Site, through eBay’s affiliate’s web sites if applicable, and in emails to eBay users.

Payment

When a qualifying Coupon recipient redeems a Coupon for the purchase of an Eligible Item, then Seller will receive payment for the Eligible Item equal to the non-discounted price of the Eligible Item as if no Coupon were used for the purchase. At the end of the Coupon Validity Period, eBay will then invoice Seller for the total Seller Funded Amount for all the Coupons that were redeemed, up to the maximum amount of the Seller Cap as defined in Attachment 1 (if any). Seller will be invoiced for the total Seller Funded Amount for their portion of coupon funding of all eligible sales from thirty (30) to forty-five (45) days after the end of the Coupon Validity Period.
For clarification, this Agreement does not change any fees due from Seller to eBay, Seller shall also pay eBay’s fees as set forth in the eBay Policies and any other agreement between Seller and eBay, all of which will be based on the non-discounted price and final value of Eligible Items, even if a Coupon was redeemed.
