On this occasion, your deal was not successful for selection. We make our selections based on a range of criteria including, but not limited to, the following:

Market-leading value: Our customers should not be able to find the exact same product at a better price by visiting other retailers for the duration of the deal period.
Relevancy for customers:â€“ products on offer should be from category areas that are seasonally relevant or in demand.
Sufficient stock: The product should be nominated as a deal in sufficient quantities to be available for the majority of the duration of the deal period.
Breadth of selection: It&#39;s important that we provide eBay customers with a breadth of selection and, as a result, we may select a range of offers that represents the full range of choice at eBay.

If you have any questions, please let us know by sending an email to ebaydeals_submissions_au@ebay.com.au.

We hope your next nomination is successful and that you submit another deal again soon.

Regards,

The eBay team</textOnly>
