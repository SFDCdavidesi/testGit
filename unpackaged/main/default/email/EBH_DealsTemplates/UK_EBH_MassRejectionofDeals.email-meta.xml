On this occasion, your deal was not successful for selection. We make our selections based on a range of criteria including, but not limited to, the following:

• Market-leading value: Our customers should not be able to find the exact same product at a better price by visiting other retailers for the duration of the deal period.
• Relevancy for customers:– products on offer should be from category areas that are seasonally relevant or in demand.
• Sufficient stock: The product should be nominated as a deal in sufficient quantities to be available for the majority of the duration of the deal period.
• Breadth of selection: It&#39;s important that we provide eBay customers with a breadth of selection and, as a result, we may select a range of offers that represents the full range of choice at eBay.

We hope you next nomination is successful and that you submit another deal again soon.

Regards,

The eBay team</textOnly>
