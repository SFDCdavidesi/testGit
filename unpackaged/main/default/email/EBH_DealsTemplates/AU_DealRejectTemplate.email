<p>On this occasion, your deal was not successful for selection. We make our selections based on a range of criteria including, but not limited to, the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>Market-leading value: Our customers should not be able to find the exact same product at a better price by visiting other retailers for the duration of the deal period.</li>

<li>Relevancy for customers:â€“ products on offer should be from category areas that are seasonally relevant or in demand.</li>

<li>Sufficient stock: The product should be nominated as a deal in sufficient quantities to be available for the majority of the duration of the deal period.</li>

<li>Breadth of selection: It's important that we provide eBay customers with a breadth of selection and, as a result, we may select a range of offers that represents the full range of choice at eBay.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions, please let us know by sending an email to <a href = "mailto: ebaydeals_submissions_au@ebay.com.au">ebaydeals_submissions_au@ebay.com.au</a>.</p>
