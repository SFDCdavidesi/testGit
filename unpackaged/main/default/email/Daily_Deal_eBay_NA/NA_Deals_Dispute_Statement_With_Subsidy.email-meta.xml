Payment Dispute Complete!


Attached is your revised {!Deal_Statement__c.Month__c} subsidy review. This adjustment will be reflected in your PayPal account within 3-5 business days. Note that returns, cancellations, items not received and sales outside that agreed upon time window do NOT count towards subsidies.


We pull the data every time at your request and risk, so items that were returned or not received since our last review/statement will not be subsidized anymore and total eligible units #s can go up OR down thus possibly resulting in a lower total subsidy total for a listing ID.


DEALS MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT REMINDERS:

Seller must review and report any error or omission regarding the Subsidy Payment for a Deal no later than ten (10) business days after receipt of the second Statement from eBay post 60 days if a Subsidy Payment is due (“Subsidy Final Settlement Date”). Seller shall be precluded from requesting any correction or adjustment to the Statement or Subsidy Payment after the Subsidy Final Settlement Date.
Seller must wait until the second reconciliation period post 60 days and final remainder amount is paid out until he sends in a dispute for quantity variance. If there was a deal missing or dates incorrect, seller shall inform us and the merchant immediately to review accordingly in order to include potential missed payouts in the second Statement.
For a period of at least two (2) years after the Deal Stop Date/Time, Seller shall keep and maintain all appropriate books and records related to the Deal, including but not limited to copies of the approved Deal Terms and records of the purchases, deliveries and returns for the Deal (“Deal Records”).

SUBSIDY FAQs


SELLER QUESTIONS

EBAY ANSWERS

My subsidized deal ran in June. When will I receive payment?

Subsidy payments are submitted in two batches: The first reconciliation occurs post 30 days, then another after 60 days from the last day of the month that the deal was live on the site. Each payment will hit the seller accounts within 3 to 5 business days of statement receipt.

My subsidized deal ran June 23rd through July 3rd. Is this considered a June deal or a July deal?

Subsidy is paid based on the first day the deal was live on the site. In this example, this deal would be included in the June subsidy statement.

My subsidy statement shows fewer units sold than our reporting tools. Why is our reporting different?

Subsidy payments are based on a listing’s net units sold, excluding transactions that are returns, cancellations, unpaid items and/or items sold outside of the subsidy window. Sellers should exclude these items when submitting error reports, which should help identify any outstanding variances between the seller’s and eBay’s reporting.

Why are there deals missing from my subsidy statement?

Contract amendments impact how deals are input into our reporting tools. Finalizing all contract changes before the deal is live on the site will eliminate deal omissions when processing payment. Sellers are expected to maintain all approved contracts to properly dispute payment variances.

I can’t locate my payment in my PayPal account. Do you have a transaction ID?

eBay does not maintain transaction IDs that correspond to the transaction IDs found in your PayPal account. In order to locate your payment, search for sender, ebaygiftcert2@ebay.com, with a confirmation message that confirms the subsidy month.
