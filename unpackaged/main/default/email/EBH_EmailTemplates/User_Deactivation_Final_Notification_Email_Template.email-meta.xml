    <textOnly>Dear {!Target_User.Email}!
Your access to Hive has been revoked due to not logging in. Hive users are automatically deactivated after 45 days with no login due to the high value of licences.
If you wish to reactivate your Hive Profile, a colleague with access to Hive will have to raise a Reactivation Ticket on your behalf.  To do this ask your colleague to click the link below and select &quot;User Reactivation&quot; from the menu:

RAISE HIVE TICKET

We are sorry to see you go!
