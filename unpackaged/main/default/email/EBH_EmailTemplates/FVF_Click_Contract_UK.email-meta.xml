    <subject>FVF Discount Form {!Action_Require}{!FVF_SellerName} {!FVF_StartDate}</subject>
    <textOnly>This e-mail is to offer You a discount on your final value fees (“FVF Discount”) for the items and/or categories and/or stores specified below.

We charge a final value fee (“FVF”) when your item(s) sell(s). The FVF charged per order consists of: (i) a variable portion (“Variable Portion FVF”) which is calculated as a percentage of the Total Sale Amount, and (ii) a fixed portion (“Fixed Portion FVF”) for example 30p, as per the terms of your Special Pricing Agreement with eBay.  The Total Sale Amount means the amount the buyer pays for an order, including any shipping charges. An order is any number of items purchased by the same buyer at checkout with the same shipping method.

The FVF Discount applies to the Variable Portion FVF (net of any other discounts). If the FVF Discount applies to specific items/categories/stores, an Excel spreadsheet will be attached to this email, referenced in the table below and will be part of this agreement.

You can accept this FVF Discount Form and the applicable terms by clicking on “I AGREE” below as soon as is practicable but in any event before the start of the Promotion Period.
