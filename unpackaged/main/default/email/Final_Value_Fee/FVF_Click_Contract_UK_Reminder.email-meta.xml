    <textOnly>Dear  {!Contact_Person__r.Name} ,

Following my email on {!Contract_Send_Date__c} regarding the Final Value Fee rebate on the attached item list “Nominated Items” I would just like to remind you that you must click ‘I agree’ to the contract in order for your rebate to be provided. If you could do this by {!Start_Date_w__c-1}, then I will be able to process your contract and provide a rebate. For your convenience, I am replicating the initial contract below.

If you have any questions, please reply to this email and I will be in touch with you as soon as possible.

Kind regards,

{!CurrentUserName}
